# Mediator-Pattern

A terminal app simulating the control tower history of an airport, reporting enqueuing, matching and landing logs
with the help of some await/async methods. By now it's not complete

[it is called Mediator-Pattern cause it started from a workspace I made to follow a 
lesson about this particular design pattern]
